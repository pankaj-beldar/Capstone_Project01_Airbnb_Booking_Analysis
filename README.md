Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Airbnb Booking Analysis
Airbnb, as in “Air Bed and Breakfast,” is a service that allows property owners to rent out their spaces/condos to travelers looking for a place to stay.
Airbnb was started in 2008 by Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, based in San Francisco California.The platform is accessible via website and mobile app.
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. 
These millions of listings generate a lot of data - data that can be analyzed and used for security, business decisions, understanding of customers' and providers' (hosts) behavior and performance on the platform, guiding marketing initiatives, implementation of innovative additional services.
An EDA is a thorough examination meant to uncover the underlying structure of a data set and is important for a company because it exposes trends, patterns, and relationships that are not readily apparent.
